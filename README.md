# psioniclysm
"A cdda mod aimed to add psionic manifestations and powers to the cdda universe."

This is an open active mod, anyone is able to inquire about where its going and how its going to get there. Suggestions are welcome.

[This mod will require some C++ coding if it goes down the direction I'm hoping it does.]

//SUMMARY [11/15/2019]
This mod intends to add a psionic metaphysical expansion to the CDDA Universe. This will come in an array of various mutations that offer traits and abilities that may aid or deter the newly awakened psion. A mutagen known as the Zeta-Serum can be found in new tilesets in labs, typically as rare loot possibly only obtainable from opening locked sample rooms or in finale rooms, recipes can be found in a Dr. Von Andrea Lab Journal as a rare spawn in labs as well. Another possible place for mutagens or possibly some new item that can induce psionic manifestations in a player character are secret temples. 

Other possible ways of being gifted with psionic abilities could be:

* Interacting with a Resonance Collider. [Gives the character a random psionic mutation upon successful activation, and after waiting out the effects of the Resonance Collider]
* Entering Portals. [Also gives a random chance of earning a random psionic ability, portals should only check this once and then a new portal must be found in order to mess with it.]	

At the moment, The theme for psychic abilities is centered around cosmic horror, a strong asset of CDDA itself. Luckily CDDA has plenty to go off in terms of lore excuses to utilize for flavour in terms of the psionics and how one can obtain them. I would personally like for psionics to be just as terrifying to the individual utilizing and experiencing them as they are useful both in game and in lore sense.

Currently, I have ideas in mind for certain effects' abilities, though I am totally open to suggestions on the matter. This is a current list of ideas and traits involved in this process, these ideas can also be interlinked or mixed, as I imagine it'll be a mix of these ideas more-so.

1. Active Psionic Abilities 

Much like the spellcasting in the Magiclysm mod, some psionic mutations will carry attributed abilities that can be activated at the cost of Psi, Vita or whatever term will be used for the energy utilized by Psionic individuals. Some ailities may also, in comination with costing Psi, cost fatigue or stamina as well, though these will generally be the more powerful of the psionic abilities present.
	
2. Passive Psionic Abilities

These passives will come from mutations and will give the player character psionic traits, these will not have activatable effects, but instead static ones, that give a clear bonus and negative to the players. An example of this would be Telepathy or Clairaudience, where the user of the atrait can distinctly hear the thoughts of creatures, and certain monsters around them--this is beneficial in that they can now get a general sense if a creature is in the area, essentially like having another set of ears--this is potentially bad however as trying to sleep, craft, and perform certain actions will be more difficult, if not impossible for the character to commit too--or even, psionic capable entities such as Migo's, Shoggoth's and some of the other netherworlders, may have an adverse affect on telepathy users and may even be able to 'track,' them psionically.
